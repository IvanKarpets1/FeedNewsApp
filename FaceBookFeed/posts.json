Even with all this progress, the number of people living on less than $2 a day is over 700 million.\nIt’s difficult for most of us—especially those living in the wealthiest countries—to imagine what life is like on less than $2 a day.\nThat’s why I’d like to invite you to listen to the voices of some of the world’s poorest people answer that question for themselves. I hope you will be touched by their stories, their challenges, and their dreams for better lives—and then ask what you can do to help the millions of people like them.",
